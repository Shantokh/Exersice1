Have you been wondering how to become a web developer?

Contrary to a popular belief, you don’t need a fancy bachelor’s degree in computer science to become a web developer and create a functional website.

In fact, if you follow the instructions in this article, you can become a web developer a lot quicker than you think (but it will still take some hard work!).

Ready? Let’s go…
What/Who is a Web Developer?

Here’s the simple answer to this question: They build and maintain websites.

In other words – they literally create how you experience the web. The websites which want users to enjoy their experience need great web developers – and they’re usually willing to fork over some serious cash to get these great web developers.

Responsibilities of a web developer:

    Write web pages with a combination of markup languages.
    Create quality mockups and prototypes.
    Build a WordPress site from scratch.
    Understand HTML and CMS.
    Understand UI and UX.
    Develop functional and appealing websites and web-based applications.
    Provide website maintenance and enhancements.

These are the most common requirements, but your responsibilities and tasks will vary depending on the web development gig as well as your web development specialty.

Speaking of web development specialties, there are 3 that you should be aware of:

    Frontend development. The “frontend” refers to “stuff” on a website that you see and interact with, e.g. menus, dropdowns, etc.
    Backend development. The “backend” is like the portion of the iceberg below the surface. Without it, the website can’t function. The backend deals with servers, applications, databases, etc.
    Full-stack development. This is the combination of both backend and frontend development.

Why Should You Become a Web Developer?

Web development is an industry that won’t die out anytime soon.

In fact, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics has predicted a 13% growth in available web development jobs through 2028.

Put simply – if you can develop this skill, you won’t have a hard time finding work for the foreseeable future.
Here are FIVE big advantages/benefits of being a web developer:

    You can work remotely. Ever wondered what it would be like to work from anywhere in the world, on your own time? As a web developer, you’ll have plenty of opportunities to work remotely. Maybe you can finally fulfill that dream of traveling the world while saving money at the same time.
    You can use your skills to build your own websites and web applications. Want to make a profitable website or application? With this skill, you won’t have to pay a ton of money to get it built. You can build it yourself for a fraction of the price.
    You can work independently. You no longer have to work under the umbrella of a boss if you don’t want to. You can freelance or start your own business much more easily when you know about web development.
    Get into the profitable tech industry. Web development is basically your ticket to the tech industry. Most tech startups have some need for web developers, so this can be your way to get your foot in the door.  
    You can build awesome stuff! The fun part is that you can be as creative as you want. Instead of looking at websites and thinking, “Wow, that looks awesome. I wish I could create something like that,” you will now be able to create your very own awesome-looking website.

What do you think? Does all of this get you excited about the idea of becoming a web developer? If so, you’re in the right place – because you’re about to learn the steps you need to take to become one!
How to Become a Web Developer
1. Learn the Basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript

Hypertext Markup Language

These are the nuts and bolts of all website development that you’ll work with daily if you decide to build websites for a living.

    HTML dictates the structure
    CSS will make it look pretty
    Javascript will make it function

Let’s discuss each one of these and how you can learn them.
HTML

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It’s one of the main ingredients of any website and one of the so-called frontend languages.

In short – it provides the basic skeleton of a website, mainly through a series of tags.

A tag is the HTML code that controls the appearance of the HTML document’s content.

Here are some common HTML tags you should get familiar with:

    <HTML>…</HTML> – This tag shows up at the beginning and end of an HTML document. It indicates that the document is written in HTML5.
    <title>…</title> – The title tag is the title for the page. This is useful both for search engines (when they scan and index pages) and users (it shows up in a browser’s title bar) by explicitly stating the primary topic of each page
    <head>…</head> – This contains information about the specific page, including title tags, metadata, and links to scripts and style sheets.
    <body>…</body> – This includes all content that will be shown to users, including everything they’ll see and read.
